  <strong>A Versatile Email, Notes, and Books Management App Built with React</strong>
</p>
<h2>👋 Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to <strong>AppSus</strong>, a multi-functional app that serves as a clone of Gmail and Google Keep, along with a comprehensive books management system. This project was created by the super talented <a href="https://github.com/EdenRize">Eden Rise</a> and me as part of our Full Stack Bootcamp at Coding Academy.
</p>
<p>
  Built with React (before we delved into Redux and Vite), AppSus is a testament to our growing skills as developers, even though it's a bit slower than our current standards. 🚀
</p>
<p>
  <strong>📱 Fully Responsive:</strong> Designed to work smoothly across various devices and screen sizes.
